      <h1>Weekly Market Wrap: Records, Rotations, and a Reality Check – August 11–15, 2025</h1>
      <p>
        The U.S. stock market delivered another week of high drama, mixing record-setting highs with
        sudden reality checks. Early in the week, investors were riding a wave of optimism after
        fresh inflation data appeared to confirm that price pressures are easing. By Friday’s close,
        however, the mood had shifted to one of cautious watchfulness as a hotter-than-expected
        Producer Price Index (PPI) reading reminded everyone that the path to lower interest rates
        is rarely straightforward.

        The S&P 500 flirted with yet another all-time high before finishing the week essentially
        flat around the 643–647 range. The Nasdaq-100, home to the market’s tech heavyweights, ended
        slightly weaker at 577, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to hold steady near
        450. Notably, small- and mid-cap stocks outperformed, with the Russell 2000 enjoying a
        roughly 3% jump—a sign that investors may be rotating into areas more sensitive to falling
        interest rates.

        The week’s rally kicked off on a positive note when the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI)
        showed inflation easing more than expected, reinforcing the case for the Federal Reserve to
        begin cutting rates as soon as September. That optimism began to fray midweek, when the PPI
        report suggested that inflationary pressures on the production side remain sticky. The
        result was a pause in the rally and a more subdued tone in trading sessions that followed.

        Corporate headlines also played a role in shaping market sentiment. UnitedHealth Group
        soared nearly 12% after Berkshire Hathaway revealed a $1.6 billion stake, providing a major
        boost to the Dow. Intel enjoyed its own surge on reports that the U.S. government is
        considering a strategic investment in its Ohio chip factory—a move that could bolster
        America’s semiconductor manufacturing ambitions.
      </p>

        Sector performance reflected this shifting landscape. Growth-oriented areas like technology
        cooled slightly, while cyclical and economically sensitive names—including many in the
        small- and mid-cap space—saw renewed buying interest. Defensive sectors such as utilities,
        consumer staples, and healthcare lagged, though some analysts argue that healthcare, in
        particular, may be setting up as an overlooked value opportunity.

        Beyond U.S. borders, China’s latest economic data pointed to slowing momentum, with both
        consumer and producer prices underperforming expectations. Yet, surprisingly, tech and chip
        stocks with exposure to China held up well, buoyed by hopes of easing trade tensions between
        Washington and Beijing.

        While the week ended without significant losses, the rally’s sustainability remains an open
        question. Goldman Sachs issued a note warning that markets are currently priced for
        perfection, riding a mix of AI-driven earnings hype and aggressive rate-cut hopes. High
        valuations, tighter credit conditions, and geopolitical flashpoints—from tariffs to global
        conflicts—could quickly trigger a reversal.
      </p>

        Looking ahead, all eyes are on the Jackson Hole Symposium later this month, where Fed Chair
        Jerome Powell will have the opportunity to either confirm or challenge the market’s dovish
        expectations. In the meantime, next week’s economic calendar—featuring housing data, retail
        earnings from Walmart and Home Depot, and the release of the Fed’s meeting minutes—will keep
        investors on their toes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the market story is one of cautious optimism: the bulls are still in control, but
        the road ahead is paved with enough uncertainty to make even the most seasoned traders watch
        their step.
