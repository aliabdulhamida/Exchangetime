          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Warren Buffett’s approach is frequently summarised as “buy wonderful businesses at fair
            prices and hold them for a long time.” Behind that aphorism sits a rigorous capital
            allocation framework: understand the economics of a business, assess durability of
            advantage, underwrite management integrity, and demand a margin of safety. In this
            weekend read, we translate those principles into a practical, modern playbook for
            today’s market structure—characterised by intangible-heavy balance sheets, platform
            dynamics, financialised buybacks, and shifting rate regimes.

          <h2>The Core Concepts, Precisely Defined</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Circle of Competence: Operate where you can build causal models, not just
              correlations. Practically, this means rejecting most pitches; depth beats breadth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Economic Moat: Sustainable excess returns due to structural advantages—switching
              costs, network effects, brand, cost advantages, regulation, or distribution lock-in.
              The test is pricing power through cycles, not marketing narratives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Owner Earnings: Reported earnings adjusted for maintenance capex, working capital
              needs, stock-based compensation dilution, and other economic costs. Cash is the score.
            </li>
            <li>
              Margin of Safety: Pay a price that leaves room for model error, adverse cycles, and
              slower growth realisation. The risk is not volatility but permanent impairment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quality at a Fair Price: A great business compounds internally; over a full cycle, the
              reinvestment runway matters more than initial multiple, within valuation discipline.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Translating Buffett to Today’s Business Models</h2>
          <h3>1) Intangibles, Software, and the New Moat Evidence</h3>
          <p>
            In 2025, many moats are invisible on the balance sheet: proprietary data, developer
            ecosystems, and installed-base lock-in. Practical moat evidence includes net dollar
            retention &gt; 110% over multiple cohorts, recurring revenue share &gt; 70%, declining
            churn with maturity, and gross margin stability despite input cost shocks (e.g., compute
            inflation). Watch pricing uplift on renewals and attach rates of adjacent modules.
          </p>
          <h3>2) “Float” Outside Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            Buffett leveraged insurance float—low-cost, long-duration liabilities—to fund equity
            compounding. Modern analogues: negative working capital models (subscriptions billed in
            advance), marketplace escrow balances, or card settlement cycles. Treat float as a
            privilege: it supports growth only if unit economics remain positive and customer trust
            is preserved.
          </p>
          <h3>3) Capital Allocation in the Buyback Era</h3>
          <p>
            Repurchases create value when intrinsic value &gt; price and the core business still
            earns excess returns. Underwrite with share-based compensation add-backs—net buyback
            yield after SBC and acquisitions. Prefer managers who flex between organic investment,
            buybacks, and M&amp;A based on marginal ROIC, not target leverage ratios.
          </p>

          <h2>Quantifying “Owner Earnings” in 2025</h2>
          <p>Move from GAAP net income to cash-based owner earnings:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Start with operating cash flow.</li>
            <li>Subtract maintenance capex (distinct from growth capex).</li>
            <li>Adjust for SBC by estimating future buyback outlay to offset dilution.</li>
            <li>Normalize working capital swings across a cycle.</li>
            <li>
              Exclude transitory gains (FX, mark-to-market) and include hidden costs (support,
              refunds).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            For SaaS, triangulate owner earnings with cohort-level unit economics: payback period
            &lt; 24 months in steady state, gross margin &gt; 70%, and sales efficiency (e.g., Magic
            Number) stabilising &gt; 0.7 after rapid growth slows.
          </p>

          <h2>Valuation Discipline when Rates and Growth Shift</h2>
          <p>
            Buffett’s playbook is rate-aware without being rate-driven. With higher real rates, the
            opportunity cost of capital rises; valuation tails compress. Practical responses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prefer businesses with self-funded growth and short cash conversion cycles.</li>
            <li>
              Demand clearer reinvestment runways; avoid paying venture-like multiples for mature
              growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use scenario-weighted DCFs rather than single-point targets; emphasise downside cases.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Behavioral Edge: Time Arbitrage</h2>
          <p>
            Markets increasingly optimise quarterly optics. A Buffett-style edge today is the
            ability to hold through temporary narrative setbacks when the 3–5 year thesis remains
            intact. Evidence of advantage compounding: improving retention, durable pricing power,
            and operating leverage emerging after growth decelerates.
          </p>
          <h3>Practical tactics to hold through narrative setbacks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Replace headline‑watching with a KPI dashboard: renewal/pricing metrics, churn, gross
              margin, and cash conversion. If these hold, sentiment noise is a feature, not a bug.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pre‑commit “checkpoints” by time, not price: re‑underwrite quarterly on drivers you
              control; avoid reacting intra‑day to narrative swings.
            </li>
            <li>Use a written thesis with explicit falsifiers; if none are hit, do nothing.</li>
            <li>Separate information from opinion: read filings/transcripts before media takes.</li>
            <li>Maintain liquidity buffers to avoid forced selling during volatility.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Buffett Would Likely Avoid</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Business models requiring perpetual external funding to cover negative unit margins.
            </li>
            <li>Commoditised front-ends with no control of distribution or supply.</li>
            <li>M&amp;A roll-ups with accounting growth but deteriorating organic KPIs.</li>
            <li>Opaque leverage structures where tail risk is mispriced or socialised.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where a Buffett Lens Might Embrace Modernity</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Capital-light platforms with network effects and consistent free cash flow conversion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Picks-and-shovels in secular build-outs (semis, tooling, mission-critical software).
            </li>
            <li>
              Exceptional operators with rational buyback/M&amp;A discipline and conservative
              balance sheets.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Practical Checklist Before Buying</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Do customers get more value the longer they stay? Cohort margins should widen.</li>
            <li>Is pricing power visible in renewals despite cost shocks?</li>
            <li>Does management allocate capital based on ROIC hierarchy, not habit?</li>
            <li>What breaks the moat—platform policy, regulation, supplier consolidation?</li>
            <li>
              What would make you sell other than price—thesis drift, governance failure, moat
              erosion?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Position Sizing and Risk</h2>
          <p>
            Buffett concentrates when variance of outcomes is low and intrinsic value growth is
            compounding. For most investors, concentration should be earned: start small, add on
            execution, reduce when underwriting weakens. Avoid leverage that turns volatility into
            solvency events. Taxes matter—low turnover and long holding periods compound after-tax.
          </p>

          <h2>Case Study Framework (Apply, Don’t Imitate)</h2>
          <p>To evaluate a candidate “Buffett stock” today, build a one-page scorecard:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Unit economics and cash conversion.</li>
            <li>Moat evidence with falsifiable indicators.</li>
            <li>Capital allocation history and stated hierarchy.</li>
            <li>Valuation versus base/mid/bear intrinsic value range.</li>
            <li>Governance, incentives, and insider behaviour.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Worked Example: Visa (Illustrative)</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 -mt-2">
            This condensed walkthrough applies the checklist to Visa as a mature, capital‑light
            network business. It’s illustrative only—update with current figures from filings and
            investor materials.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Quality &amp; Moat: Global two‑sided network with acceptance density and brand trust;
              high switching costs for issuers/merchants; pricing power evidenced by stable
              take‑rates through cycles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cash &amp; Unit Economics: Asset‑light model with strong FCF conversion; capex modest;
              working capital favorable; revenue tied to volumes rather than credit risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capital Allocation: Consistent buybacks and growing dividend; M&amp;A targeted at
              capabilities (risk, value‑added services); balance sheet conservative.
            </li>
            <li>
              Valuation Discipline: Scenario DCF with mid‑teens operating margin resilience in base
              case; margin of safety sought during macro‑driven sell‑offs when volume growth fears
              are transient.
            </li>
            <li>
              Risks &amp; Falsifiers: Regulatory fee caps, closed‑loop competitors, displacement by
              alternative rails; monitor cross‑border volumes, incentives ratio, and pricing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Position Sizing: Earned concentration given durable economics; add on execution and
              when IV‑price gap widens without KPI degradation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            Buffett’s methods are not about nostalgia; they’re about disciplined thinking under
            uncertainty. In markets shaped by software, platforms, and intangibles, his emphasis on
            cash economics, durable moats, and aligned stewardship is more, not less, relevant.
            Apply the principles with modern metrics—own fewer, better businesses, and let time do
            the heavy lifting.

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Evidence moats with hard KPIs, not stories; prefer pricing power through cycles.
            </li>
            <li>Rebuild owner earnings from cash; separate maintenance vs. growth spending.</li>
            <li>
              Allocate based on marginal ROIC; buy back only below intrinsic value, net of SBC.
            </li>
            <li>Model ranges, not points; insist on a margin of safety before acting.</li>
            <li>Write your sell triggers up front; use a KPI dashboard to outlast narratives.</li>
          </ul>
